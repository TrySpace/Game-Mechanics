# Edge Offset

The jump detection area extends beyond the exact edge, creating a tolerance zone around the player. This allows for timing forgiveness - jumping later within this zone still results in the optimal jump trajectory, as if the player had timed it perfectly.

## Benefits
- Players can jump early (shorter distance) or late (optimal distance)
- Encourages precise timing without punishing slight mistakes
- Reduces frustration from edge detection issues

## Diagonal Tolerance
Sloped edges (greater than 90Â° downward) provide additional timing leniency for late jumps.
